# Beiwe-Project

To compile and run the codes,<br>
    -First create a new java project in your compiler.<br>
    -Then download everything here as a zipped file and unzip it into the 'src' folder of your new project.<br>
        -The folder 'kmeans' must be kept right inside the 'src' without creating any extra folder, otherwise you have to change the package name accordingly.<br>
    -You need the Beiwe Power State Data downloaded. Add the directory by editing line 14 in the file 'kmeans/powerStateData/PowerStateFilesReader.java'.
