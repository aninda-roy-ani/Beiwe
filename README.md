# Beiwe-Project

To compile and run the codes,<br>
-First create a new java project in your compiler, go to project directory and delete everything inside 'src' folder.<br>
-Then download this repository as a zipped file and unzip it into the 'src' folder of your new project.<br>
-The folder 'kmeans' must be kept right inside the 'src' without creating any extra folder, otherwise you have to change the package name accordingly.<br>
-You also need the Beiwe Power State Data downloaded. Add the directory by editing line 14 in the file 'kmeans/powerStateData/PowerStateFilesReader.java'.
